Seamlessly access all your favourite Ethereum dashboards in one convenient
location. Monitor the latest network stats, keep an eye on Ethereum
staking, and even monitor your favourite wallets, with plenty more
features coming soon!

The ethdash Chrome extension is a companion to the
ethdash.xyz site created in 2022. We put all of your favourite Ethereum Dashboards in one place, and now we&apos;re taking it one step further by having them one-click away as a browser extension. Thanks again to Superphiz for getting the idea started!

## Next.js 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
